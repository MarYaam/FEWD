    <h3>History</h3>
        <p>In	1922,	August	Krogh	and	his	wife	Marie	Krogh	travelled	to	the	US.	The	couple	had	heard	reports	of	people	with
        diabetes	being	treated	with	insulin	– a	hormone	discovered	in	1921	by	two	Canadians,	Frederick	Banting	and	Charles
        Best.	Marie	Krogh	was	a	doctor	herself	and	also	had	type	2	diabetes.	The	couple	returned	to	Denmark	with	permission
        to	manufacture	and	sell	insulin	in	Scandinavia.	With	the	economic	help	from	August	Kongsted	– the	owner	of	Leo
        Pharmaceutical	Products	- Insulin	Leo	was	marketed	in	1923.</p>

        <p>When	Krogh	and	Hagedorn	started	manufacturing	insulin,	they	hired	Thorvald	Pedersen	and	his	brother	Harald
        Pedersen	to	build	the	machines for	insulin	production.	However,	Thorvald	Pedersen	was	fired	and	the	two	brothers
        decided	to	try	to	manufacture	insulin	themselves.	Thorvald	and	Harald	Pedersen	managed	to	produce	a	stable	liquid
        insulin	and marketed	Insulin	Gen in	1925. The	brothers	named	their	firm	Novo	Industri the	world’s	first	insulin
        preparation	identical	to	human	insulin.</p>

        <p>In	1989,	Novo	Industri and	Nordisk	Gentofte merged	to	become	GenXen	Labs,	the	world's	largest	producer	of	insulin
        with	headquarters	in	Bagsværd,	Copenhagen.	In	2000	the	company	demerged	into	GenZen and	GenX	Pharmaceuticals.
        In	2015,	the	company	announced	it	would	collaborate	with	Ablynx,	using	its	nanobody	technology	to	develop	at	least
        one	new	drug	candidate.	Research	into	blood disorders	lead	to	the	foundation	of	The	GenX	Pharmaceuticals
        Haemophilia	Foundation	in	2005	which,	amongst	other	things, pledges	an	annual	donation	of	one-million	US	dollars.</p>
